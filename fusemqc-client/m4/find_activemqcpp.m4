dnl find_decaf.m4 : locate the decaf include files and libraries
dnl
dnl This macro file can be used by applications to find and use the Decaf
dnl library. It provides a standardized mechanism for using Decaf. It supports
dnl embedding Decaf into the application source, or locating an installed
dnl copy of Decaf.
dnl
dnl AC_FIND_ACTIVEMQCPP(srcdir, builddir, implicit-install-check, acceptable-majors)
dnl
dnl   where srcdir is the location of the bundled ActiveMQ-CPP source directory, or
dnl   empty if source is not bundled.
dnl
dnl   where builddir is the location where the bundled ActiveMQ-CPP will will be built,
dnl   or empty if the build will occur in the srcdir.
dnl
dnl   where implicit-install-check set to 1 indicates if there is no
dnl   --with-decaf option specified, we will look for installed copies.
dnl
dnl   where acceptable-majors is a space separated list of acceptable major
dnl   version numbers. Often only a single major version will be acceptable.
dnl   If multiple versions are specified, and --with-decaf=PREFIX or the
dnl   implicit installed search are used, then the first (leftmost) version
dnl   in the list that is found will be used.  Currently defaults to [0 1].
dnl
dnl Sets the following variables on exit:
dnl
dnl   amqcpp_found : "yes", "no", "reconfig"
dnl
dnl   activemqcpp_config : If the activemqcpp-config tool exists, this refers to it. If
dnl                        amqcpp_found is "reconfig", then the bundled directory
dnl                        should be reconfigured *before* using activemqcpp_config.
dnl
dnl Note: this macro file assumes that activemqcpp_config has been installed; it
dnl       is normally considered a required part of an ActiveMQ-CPP installation.
dnl
dnl If a bundled source directory is available and needs to be (re)configured,
dnl then amqcpp_found is set to "reconfig". The caller should reconfigure the
dnl (passed-in) source directory, placing the result in the build directory,
dnl as appropriate.
dnl
dnl If amqcpp_found is "yes" or "reconfig", then the caller should use the
dnl value of activemqcpp_config to fetch any necessary build/link information.

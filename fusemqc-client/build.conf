# Build Configuration File, used by the Build.sh script to configure how
# the Library is built, where it is installed, etc.  This file is used in
# combination with the build.sh script included with ActiveMQ-C.  The
# values in the conf file can be overridden by a user by creating a user
# specific conf file in the user's home folder named ".activemqcrc".
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Defines the location where the code is built and the configuration data
# is stored, this location is deleted any time that the clean option is
# passed to the build.sh script so don't set this to a directory like ./src
# AMQC_BUILD_DIR="${PWD}/build"

# Defines the install location for the ActiveMQ-C library and its headers
# AMQC_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

# Defines the library directory where the ActiveMQ-C library is placed.
# This is normally set to AMQC_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib on a 64bit Fedora OS
# for instance set this to AMQC_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib64 to place the 64bit
# library in the correct library dir to match the architecture.
# AMQC_LIBDIR=/usr/lib64

# Defines the location of the CPPUnit distribution you wish to build and link
